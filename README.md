#  Market Analysis Report for National Clothing Chain

## Introduction

An online national clothing chain is facing flat sales and aims to re-engage lost customers through a targeted marketing campaign. The goal is to identify the best product (Shirt: $25, Sweater: $100, Leather Bag: $1,000) to advertise to specific customers in specific locations. This project involves analyzing various data sources to understand customer income, product performance, and potential correlations to drive effective targeting.

## Project Instructions

This project requires analyzing several datasets to provide actionable insights for the marketing campaign. You will leverage population statistics from the US Census Bureau to understand income distribution across the country and explore the correlation between sales and income. By comparing customer purchase history and locations with census data, you will develop a method to predict customer income. Furthermore, an analysis of product inventory, focusing on customer ratings and return rates, will determine any existing correlations.

## Analysis Questions:

This project aims to answer the following key business questions:

1.  **What is the correlation (R² value) between sales and income?**
2.  **What is the correlation (R² value) between customer ratings and product return rate?**
3.  **What are the linear regression formulas to predict customer income from customer sales?**
4.  **Which customer do you predict has the highest income?** (Based on the analysis)
